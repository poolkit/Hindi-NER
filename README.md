### Named Entity Recognition for Hindi Language

Hindi Language named entity recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and categorizing named entities like people, organizations, locations, and dates in Hindi language text. 
Hindi is widely spoken in India and other parts of the world, so there is a growing need for NER systems that can handle Hindi text. However, NER for Hindi is challenging because of the complexity of the language, a lack of annotated data, and the need for specific tools and resources.
